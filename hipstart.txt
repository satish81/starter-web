HipStart featured in Carroll Country Times: For Vehslage and his invention, ‘it’s all in the hips’

 purchased the HIPSTART so I can warm up the hips before playing round of golf. If you every played sports. The key is warming up and stretching to have balanced body in tune before playing. It truly helps with muscle memory as well. I have to say it was able to hit the ball straighter because with pre warm up helped me swing with balance in excel in power. I recently few years back suffered a back injury , and it was able to loosen those areas that tightens over time when playing so I can play with enjoyment again. Absolutely the best warm up tool before you play your sport. I cannot be happier. I will buy a lot for friends. Maybe not golf buddies because I want to beat them using this edge now.
